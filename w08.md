# Week 08 top 10 list of interesting OS things

1. [Asymmetric Multiprocessing](https://networkencyclopedia.com/asymmetric-multiprocessing-amp/)<br>
This website describes in detail all you need to know about AMP or Assymmetric Multirprocessing. There is also a helpful little video for further information on the topic

2. [Symmetric Multiprocessing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/symmetric-multi-processor)<br>
Besides Asymmetric Multiprocessing there is symmetric processing, the details of this are further explored and explained in the website that I just shared.
  
 
3. [Processor Affinity](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/processor-affinity-windows)<br>
This website has a very helpful guide on what exactly is Processor affinity and how to set it up in windows 10. The example of appling it on windows 10 is gonna really help people who read this understand the concept much better.

 
 4. [NUMA: Non-Uniform Memory Access](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-Q02b5uvfY&ab_channel=Level1Techs)<br>
 This video demonstrates with a actual PC what exactly is a NUMA or Non Uniform Memory Access. The use of a PC really helps us better understand how it physically affects the PC and everything around it which is cool.

 5. [Load Balancing](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/load-balancing/)<br>
 Load balancing refers to efficiently distributing incoming network traffic across a group of backend servers, also known as a server farm or server pool. Helpful and detailed explanations of every process helps us truly understand the concept of Load Balancing
 

 6. [Real Time Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3XjhJ7Ex1Y&ab_channel=DavidEvans)<br>
 This video of a college lecture is a very handy source of information about the inner workings of Real time scheduling. I personally found the video explanation format very useful in this learning situation.

  
 7. [Big O Notation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6xkbGLQesk)<br>
 Big O notations were one of the many things that I studied in Structured Data Algorithms and it took me a while to understand how it really works. But one of the videos that helped me understand that concept was this video. Examples of functions for every Big-O were super crucial in helping me understand the whole idea of this specific concept.
 
8.  [CPU and I/O Burst Cycles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVzb3TUcDLo&ab_channel=NesoAcademy)<br>
  A very simple 8 minute video about the differences between a CPU burst and a I/O burst cycle. Short,sweet, and simple enough for most people to understand the main idea of the topic.
 
  
 9. [Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4DhFmL-6SDA&ab_channel=NesoAcademy)<br>
 After I watched the video on CPU and I/O burst cycles, the youtube algorithm played the next video in the playlist which was a video about Preemptive and Non-Preemptive Scheduling. The video discussed the concepts of the CPU Scheduler, Dispatcher, Preemptive Scheduling, and Non-Preemptive Scheduling. So in truth, it was a very useful video and I highly recommend it.

 
 
 10. [What Is an OVA File?](https://www.lifewire.com/ova-file-4144357)<br>
This well written and cool looking article explains what an OVA file is and all the things I can do with one. A really helpful article that aided me when I was confused on the subject myself. It's complete with screenshots to better explain the steps and also the website itself is very pleasing on the eye so you wont get bored reading it (hopefully).
