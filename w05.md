# Week 05 top 10 list of interesting OS things

1. [Allocation of Frames](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
This website explains in detail what exactly is an allocation frame. It also has detailed examples about all the types of algorithms and allocation methods that are used in this process


 2. [Demand Paging](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-demand-paging)<br>
 Sometimes the computer needs certain pages in the main memory but because there are too many already, it cant do so. This is where demand paging comes in, it basically stores all the pages required in the secondary memory until it is required by the main memory. This website explains how exactly does your computer benefit from this.
 

 
 
 3. [Copy On Write](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/copy-on-write/)<br>
 Copy on write is a resource manegement technique which handles all the pages in the OS. More details on this subject are present in the website that i've linked.
 

 
 4. [Non-Uniform Memory Access](https://www.motioncontroltips.com/what-is-non-uniform-memory-access-in-industrial-controls/)<br>
 If u want your processor to be able to access contents of memory way faster than the standard techniques, NUMA is the way to go. This is possible because of the fact that NUMA's have each their own exclusive local memory for their own use.


 
 
 5. [Memory-mapped IO vs Port-mapped IO](https://www.bogotobogo.com/Embedded/memory_mapped_io_vs_port_mapped_isolated_io.php)<br>
 From the outside looking in Memory mapped IO and Port mapped IO have nearly identical features, but where we can differenciate them is within the microprocessers of each IO. This website explains further what i mean by microprocessor.
 

 

 
 6. [Page Replacement Algorithm](https://www.javatpoint.com/os-page-replacement-algorithms)<br>
 
 
 
 
 
 7. [Page Fault](https://techterms.com/definition/page_fault)<br>


 
 8. [What is a kernel](https://www.thewindowsclub.com/what-is-a-kernel-in-os-what-are-the-types-of-kernel)<br>

 

 
 9. [Thrashing](http://iim6.tripod.com/ibam-os-html/x4404.html)<br>


 
 
 
 10. [Belady Anomaly](https://prepinsta.com/operating-systems/beladys-anomaly/)<br>
