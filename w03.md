# Week 03 top 10 list of interesting OS things

1. [What is an Access Control List](https://www.ittsystems.com/access-control-list-acl/)<br>
An access control list is a compilation of ACE's made by an operating system that are designed to monitor and control certain behavioral security patterns that are linked to a specific object. It controls traffic flow control and gives a level of security by giving information on which specific areas of the server/network the user can access.

 2. [What is Trojan virus?](https://www.kaspersky.com/resource-center/threats/trojans)<br>
 The term trojan virus comes from the ancient greek story of how the deception of a a giant wooden horse led to the demise of the city of troy. The story is after a long battle, the greeks hid inside this giant horse and pretended to sail away to make the trojans think they had won the battle. the trojans then took it in to their city under the idea that this was their victory trophy. Little did they know the greeks inside launched a surprise attack which led to the trojans downfall. The way the greeks snuck in to the trojan city is very similar to the way this virus will sneak into your computer.
 
 
 3. [Access matrix in Operating Systems](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/access-matrix-in-operating-system/#:~:text=Access%20Matrix%20is%20a%20security%20model%20of%20protection%20state%20in%20computer%20system.&text=Access%20matrix%20is%20used%20to,domains%20and%20columns%20represent%20objects.)<br>
 An access matrix in a OS is basically a security model specifically design to project the computer systems. It does this by characterizing the rights of each subject with respect ot every ibject in the system. As u can imagine its data structure is in the shape of a traditional mathematical matrix.
 

 
 4. [User Authentication](https://www.cs.unibo.it/~babaoglu/courses/security/lucidi/pdf/passwd.pdf)<br>
 User authentication is the process of proving to the Operating System that you are indeed the same user that has enough authority to access said Operating system. This process is usually done by log in with a password and is the most standard way most websites authenticate their users/clients.
 
 
 5. [How does a computer virus spread?](http://www1.udel.edu/topics/virus/v-infect.htm)<br>
 I've always wondered how these viruses suddenly show up on someones laptop. An average person like myself probably has no idea about the effects a computer virus can have on our computers, let alone how they spread. This article helped me understand that concept a little better.

 
 6. [Goals of protection](https://ecestudy.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/unit5_part_1.pdf)<br>
 The goals of protection are basically some clear guidelines on what a security system must protect and what boundaries must they obey to be able to execute that task.

 
 7. [Common computer viruses](https://hightouchtechnologies.com/9-common-types-of-computer-viruses/)
 I guarantuee most people dont even know how dangerous a computer virus can be to their laptop until they get infected by one. This article sheds more light on what exactly are the most common computer viruses and specific details that you might not have known before.

 
 8. [Symmetric vs asymmetric Encryption](https://sectigostore.com/blog/5-differences-between-symmetric-vs-asymmetric-encryption/)<br>
 Encryption is known as the process of locking up certain information using cryptography. We no longer can access this information anymore because it is as they say encrypted. There are 2 types of encryptions and this article gets in to more detail about what exactly that difference is.
 

 
 9. [General knowledge of System Security](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/system-security/)
 This whole article acts as sort of a general cheatsheet about all the aspects of system security which is super helpful. It may be common knowledge for people who are already well versed in security systems, but its important to everyone as computer users to better understand the complexities of system security.
 
 
 10. [How to keep your personal information secure](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0272-how-keep-your-personal-information-secure)<br>
 The internet is a very dangerous place in more ways than you can imagine. One of the most prized assets that someone can have is their information, this is exactly why we need to learn about ways to better navigate the internet so that our privated important data does not get into the wrong peoples hands.
