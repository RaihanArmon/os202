# Week 03 top 10 list of interesting OS things

1. [What is disk partition](https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/p/partition.htm#:~:text=When%20referring%20to%20a%20computer,run%20on%20the%20same%20device.)<br>
A disk partition is the creation of smaller/seperate regions on the secondary stage, that enables it to be managed seperately. It is seperated from the rest of the hard drive and helps users do multiple things on the same device. Such as run multiple OS's on the same device, this is possible because of disk partinion enabling seperation of a physical disk into its own specific section.


 2. [File System Interface](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/operating-system-concepts/9780471694663/ch10.html#:~:text=The%20file%20system%20consists%20of,the%20files%20in%20the%20system.)<br>
 The file system interface is how the user generally interacts with the files that are at his/her disposal. The interface consists of two main parts which are the collection of files filled with important adn relevant data, and the directory structure, which contains all the crucial information needed about all the files that can be accessed in the system.

 
 
 3. [File organization methods](https://peda.net/kenya/css/subjects/computer-studies/form-three/driac2/data-processing/fom#:~:text=File%20organization%20refers%20to%20the,files%20on%20a%20storage%20media.)<br>
 We need to be able to organize our files in a way that is both effective and easy to use. We do this by learning about different methods and their strengths and weaknesses, and all this information is in this article. It explains that there are 4 main methods of file organization which are equential, random, serial and indexed-sequential. Each method has their pros and cons, and its up to you to choose which one suits you best.
 

 
 4. [types of files in Operating Systems](https://www.guru99.com/file-systems-operating-system.html)<br>
 The Operating System is responsible for a lot of things, including data file managing. It does this by differentiating the details of each file so that it knows what to do with each specific file. This article explains a little further about all the different and varied types of files that the OS will have to acknowledge.
