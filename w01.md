# Week 01 top 10 list of interesting OS things

1. [Understanding then downloading VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch01.html)<br>
At first glance i was very confused on what even was a virtuaLBox and why do i even need to download this, but slowly and surely i started to understand what exactly was a VirtualBox. Virtualbox is basically an visualisation software that is used to run multiple OSes at the same time on multiple virtual machines. With this you can basically download whatever OS you want on whatever PC you wish. For example on my laptop i can be running iOS and windows at the same time, and all of this is thanks to the VirtualBox. With this you can do test all sorts of things and maybe learn about server virtualization. All of this is free!

 2. Learning some Command-Line Interface commands
 While reading the slides and doing the assignment i was particularly fascinated by all the commands i could do. As soon as I knew what i was doing, I Immediately started testing out all the combinations just to see what they would do. This certainly helped me understand the commands and Bash a little more than if i had just read these from a textbook without practicing.
 
 3.[What is a Virtual Machine](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/what-is-a-virtual-machine/)<br>
i was sort of confused at first on what exactly a virtual machine is, thankfully i found this website that gives a really detailed explanation on what it actually is. To sum it up, a virtual machine is sort of an independent window (it doesnt bother/tamper with the main computer) and acts as a sort of testing ground for anyone looking to see the different outcomes when you run multiple operating systems at the same time, or you can do other different tests as well.
